## [Unreleased][unreleased]

## [5.6.0] - 2020-12-08

### Added

- Support for Terraform v0.14

## [5.5.0] - 2020-08-25

### Added

- Support for Terraform v0.13.

### Security
- Updated all gem versions to remediate ActiveSupport vulnerability, a dependency of the train gem.

## [5.4.0] - 2020-05-31

### Added

- Support for Ruby 2.7.

### Changed

- Gem deployment to RubyGems now takes place with GitHub Actions. Unit and Integration tests remain in Travis CI and Appveyor.

## [5.3.0] - 2020-03-08

### Added

- Verifier systems have a `bastion_host_output` attribute which allows 
  a bastion host to be obtained from a Terraform output rather than 
  statically defined with the `bastion_host` attribute.

### Fixed

- All plugin log messages use consistent levels.
- The output of the `terraform output` command has been reverted to log 
  at the debug level rather than the warn level.

## [5.2.0] - 2020-02-27

The "trapped in Atlanta" edition!

### Changed

- Log messages have been adjusted to provide better context and
  actionable information where approriate.

- The dependency on mixlib-shellout has been updated to support
  installation using ChefDK versions 3.9 and newer.

## [5.1.1] - 2019-08-28

### Fixed

- RbNaCl was removed from the gem dependencies to solve for an
  unexpected compatibility issue with InSpec's GCP transport [#351].
  Installation instructions were linked in the README for
  configurations which may require this gem.

## [5.1.0] - 2019-07-06

### Changed

- InSpec 3 is supported again. It must be explicitly pinned in the
  `Gemfile`, like `gem "inspec", "~> 3.0"`.

### Fixed

- Default values for unsupported configuration attributes inherited
  from the base Kitchen plugins were removed.

## [5.0.0] - 2019-06-06

### Changed

- The supported version of InSpec is 4. This version changes the
  priority of profile attributes configurations:
  1. `systems.x.attrs_outputs`
  1. the default association of attributes to Terraform outputs
  1. `systems.x.attrs`

## [4.9.0] - 2019-05-27

### Added

- Support for Terraform v0.12.

## [4.8.1] - 2019-05-11

### Fixed

- Added a reference to the `client` attribute in the driver
  documentation.
- Corrected the attribute name in the `verify_version` example.

## [4.8.0] - 2019-04-14

### Added

- The verifier exposes input variables configured through the
  `variables` attribute as InSpec profile attributes prefixed with
  `input_`; refer to the updated
  [Terraform Verifier documentation][terraform-verifier] for more
  details.

### Changed

- The verifier exposes output variables as InSpec profile attributes
  prefixed with `output_`, though the unprefixed variety of attributes
  are still available for backward compatibility; refer to the updated
  [Terraform Verifier documentation][terraform-verifier] for more
  details.

## [4.7.0] - 2019-04-13

### Added

- The verifier systems gained a `profile_locations` attribute which
  enables overriding the default InSpec profile location of
  `test/integration/<KITCHEN SUITE NAME>`; refer to the updated
  [Terraform Verifier documentation][terraform-verifier] for more
  details.

### Changed

- Errors are logged when they are queued while `fail_fast` is disabled.

## [4.6.0] - 2019-04-11

### Added

- The verifier gained a `fail_fast` attribute which toggles fail fast
  behaviour when verifying systems; refer to the updated
  [Terraform Verifier documentation][terraform-verifier] for more details.

## [4.5.0] - 2019-04-10

### Changed

- The output of `terraform output` is logged at the debug level to
  prevent sensitive output values from being printed by default. This
  output can be viewed by enabling the debug log level. For example:
  `kitchen converge INSTANCE --log-level=debug`

## [4.4.0] - 2019-04-06

### Added

- The driver gained a `client` configuration attribute which contains
  the pathname to the Terraform client; refer to the
  [Terraform Driver documentation][terraform-driver] for more details.

### Fixed

- The verifier lost legacy code which was implicity coupled to the SSH
  transport and integrated with InSpec in undocumented ways.

## [4.3.0] - 2019-01-20

### Changed

- `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS` is no longer automatically set when running
  `terraform apply` during `kitchen converge`. This change should allow
  output errors to be more quickly exposed to the user.

## [4.2.1] - 2019-01-19

### Changed

- `terraform validate` is now called without `-check-variables=true`.
  This flag already defaults to `true` and will be obsolete for
  Terraform v0.12.

## [4.2.0] - 2018-12-29

### Added

- The driver gained a `:verify_version` configuration attribute which
  toggles verification of support for the available Terraform version.
  This feature allows unsupported versions of Terraform to be used.

- The gem supports Ruby v2.6.

## [4.1.1] - 2018-12-13

### Fixed

- The Terraform workspace is selected before outputs are retrieved.

## [4.1.0] - 2018-12-09

### Changed

- The bundled version of InSpec is now ~> 3.0. Despite the major
  version change, it is intended to be backward compatible.

## [4.0.6] - 2018-12-02

### Fixed

- `terraform output` is moved from `kitchen converge` to
  `kitchen verify` to ensure Terraform state outputs are up to date for
  use as InSpec attributes regardless of the result of
  `kitchen converge`.

## [4.0.5] - 2018-12-01

### Fixed

- The escaping of Terraform command-line arguments... Again! Arguments
  for `-backend-config` and `-var` are surrounded by double quotes but
  are not escaped. This compromise is intended to ensure proper
  handling of arguments containing HashiCorp Language (HCL) on Linux,
  MacOS, and Windows. The corresponding values for the Kitchen
  configuration attributes `driver.backend_configurations` and
  `driver.variables` must be properly escaped depending on the execution
  environment. The [Kitchen configuration file](kitchen.yml) used for
  integration testing of Kitchen-Terraform contains examples of escaped
  HCL values.

## [4.0.4] - 2018-11-21

### Fixed

- The escaping of Terraform command-line arguments

## [4.0.3] - 2018-10-03

### Changed

- The version of InSpec was relaxed to include all versions between 2.2
  and 3

## [4.0.2] - 2018-09-26

### Changed

- The version of InSpec was relaxed to include 2.2.70 to enable
  compatability with ChefDK 3.2.30

## [4.0.1] - 2018-09-15

### Fixed

- The version of InSpec was pinned to 2.2.78 as 2.2.101 introduced a
  breaking change to the InSpec profile attributes system

## [4.0.0] - 2018-08-13

"An open-source software release is never late. Nor is it early. It
arrives precisely when the maintainers get around to finishing it." -
Gandalf the Free-As-In-Beer

### Added

- The verifier configuration gained a `:systems` attribute which
  replaced the `:groups` attribute; refer to the updated
  [Terraform Verifier documentation][terraform-verifier] for more
  details

- The Terraform shell out environment now enables
  `TF_WARN_OUTPUT_ERRORS` to work around
  [Terraform issue #17655][terraform-issue-17655]

### Changed

- Support for Terraform < 0.11.4 was broken

- Support for InSpec < 2.2.34 was broken

- Support for InSpec >= 2.2.34, < 3 was introduced

- Support for Kitchen < 1.20.0 was broken

- Support for Kitchen ~> 1.23 was introduced

- Support for Ruby 2.2 was broken

- Support for concurrency with the following commands was broken:
  `create`, `converge`, `setup`, and `destroy`

- The deprecated `terraform destroy -force` flag was replaced with the
  supported `terraform destroy -auto-approve` flag

- The working directory of the Terraform shell out environment was
  changed to the value of the `:root_module_directory` attribute of the
  driver configuration

- Support for the `:groups` attribute of the verifier configuration was
  broken; `:systems` replaces `:groups`

- InSpec was reconfigured to use the Kitchen logger for all logging

- InSpec was reconfigured to exclusively return 0 and 1 as exit codes

## [3.3.1] - 2018-04-29

### Changed

- Deprecating support for Ruby 2.2; this version reaches end of life on
  March 31, 2018

- Deprecating support for concurrency with the following commands:
  `create`, `converge`, `setup`, and `destroy`; these commands invoke
  Terraform in a manner which is not safe for concurrency

### Fixed

- Escaping the following configuration attributes for safe usage in the
  shell out commands:

  - backend_configurations
  - plugin_directory
  - root_module_directory
  - variable_files
  - variables

- Loading of Kitchen constants to enable the use of Kitchen Rake tasks

## [3.3.0] - 2018-03-22

### Added

- The `lock` configuration attribute of the driver toggles locking of
  the Terraform state file

## [3.2.0] - 2018-03-21

### Added

## Code of Conduct

Contributors to Kitchen-Terraform are expected to adhere to the
[Kitchen-Terraform Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any
unacceptable conduct should be reported to
kitchen-terraform@newcontext.com.

## Questions

Questions about the project may be posed on the
[GitHub issue tracker][github-issue-tracker] or in the
[Gitter chat][gitter-chat].

## Project Technologies

Familiarity with the following technologies is important in
understanding the design and behaviour of Kitchen-Terraform.

- [Ruby][ruby]
- [Test Kitchen][test-kitchen]
- [Terraform][terraform]
- [Inspec][inspec]

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs must be reported on the
[GitHub issue tracker](github-issue-tracker). Any information that will
assist in the maintainers reproducing the bug should be included.

## Suggesting Changes

Changes should be suggested on the
[GitHub issue tracker](github-issue-tracker). Submitting a pull request
with an implementation of the changes is also encouraged but not
required.

## Developing

The development workflow for both the Kitchen-Terraform Ruby gem and the
documentation web site follow the same
[standard GitHub workflow](fork-a-repo).

### Ruby Gem

#### Unit Testing

[RSpec][rspec] is used as the unit testing framework.

The following command will execute the unit tests.

> Executing unit tests with RSpec

```sh
bin/rspec
```

[.rspec](.rspec) contains command line options which will be
automatically applied.

[spec/spec_helper.rb](spec/spec_helper.rb) contains framework
configuration.

The files under [spec/lib](spec/lib) contain the executable descriptions
of the different units of the Ruby gem.

The files under [spec/support](spec/support) contain supporting logic
like shared examples and shared contexts.

[Guard][guard] can be used to automate the execution of unit tests
during the development process.

The following command will start the process to detect file changes and
run appropriate unit tests.

> Watching for file changes with Guard

```sh
bin/guard
```

#### Integration Testing

The [Terraform Docker provider][terraform-docker-provider] is used to
run integration tests against a real Terraform state.

The Terraform module under
[integration/docker_provider](integration/docker_provider) includes
Kitchen-Terraform configuration and an InSpec profile used to verify
features of Kitchen-Terraform.

#### Analyzing Code Quality

[Code Climate][code-climate] is used to analyze the quality of the
source code of the Ruby gem.

[.codeclimate.yml](.codeclimate.yml) contains analysis configuration.

A [command line interface][code-climate-cli] is available to run the
analysis locally.

#### Continuously Integrating and Continuously Deploying

[Travis CI][travis-ci] is used to provide continuous integration and
continuous deployment functionality for the Ruby gem.

[.travis.yml](.travis.yml) contains job configuration.

Unit tests and integration tests will be executed for each commit to the
master branch and each commit to a branch with an open pull request.

If a commit to the master branch has a [tag][git-tag] then the job will
attempt to build the Ruby gem and deploy it to [RubyGems][ruby-gems].

#### Releasing

Changes will be committed to the master branch as they are completed.
When the goals of the next project milestone have been achieved, the
master branch will be tagged with a new version number which will
trigger a release of the Ruby gem.

### Web Site

The web site comprises documentation, examples, and tutorials for
working with Kitchen-Terraform.

The web site published on the master branch is hosted at
<https://newcontext-oss.github.io/kitchen-terraform/>.

#### Writing Content

The web site uses the [Middleman][middleman] framework.

The following command will run the Middleman server so that changes to
the content can be reviewed at <http://localhost:4567/>.

> Running Middleman server to review content changes

```sh
env NO_CONTRACTS=true bin/middleman server --build-dir docs
```

[config.rb](config.rb) contains Middleman configuration.

[source](source) contains the source files for the web site.

[docs](docs) contains the compiled web site.

#### Building Site

The following command will build an HTML site based on the Middleman
project.

> Building HTML site based on Middleman project

```sh
bin/middleman build --build-dir docs
```

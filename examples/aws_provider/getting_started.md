# Getting Started

Hello! This tutorial will walk you through setting up a Terraform config
to spin up an [Amazon Web Services (AWS)] EC2 instance using Inspec and
kitchen-terraform from scratch.

(Note: these instructions are for Unix based systems only)

## Our Tools

* [Terraform]
* [Test Kitchen]
* [InSpec]
* [kitchen-terraform]

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites for this tutorial

* An AWS Account
* An AWS Access Key ID
* An AWS Secret Key
* An AWS Keypair
* Terraform installed
* Bundler installed
* Ruby 2.3.1
* The default security group on your account must allow SSH access from
  your IP address

So let's start building this config from scratch!

## Setting up our development environment

First, let's create a new directory for our config:

```bash
$ mkdir tf_aws_cluster
```

And cd into that directory:

```bash
$ cd tf_aws_cluster
```

Now, create some skeleton terraform files:

```bash
$ touch main.tf variables.tf output.tf testing.tfvars
```

Add in a `Gemfile`:

```bash
$ vim Gemfile
```

Edit the `Gemfile ` and add in the `kitchen-terraform` gem like so:

```ruby
ruby '2.3.1'

source 'https://rubygems.org/' do
  gem 'test-kitchen'
  gem 'kitchen-terraform'
end
```

Close and save the file then run `bundler` to install these gems:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Setting up Test Kitchen

Now let's set up Test Kitchen.

Go ahead and open your `.kitchen.yml` file:

```bash
$ vim .kitchen.yml
```

Let's go ahead and add in configuration for for both Test Kitchen and
kitchen-terraform in the `.kitchen.yml` config file.

kitchen-terraform provides three plugins for use with Test Kitchen - a
driver, a provisioner, and a verifier. We will go through each of these
plugins in this tutorial.

First the driver - the driver we are using is called `terraform`.

Edit the `.kitchen.yml`:

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: terraform
```

Now let's add the provisioner. The provisioner we will use is also
called `terraform`.

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: terraform

provisioner:
  name: terraform
  variable_files:
    - testing.tfvars
```

Now, we need to add in a platform. Although our terraform config will
determine what OS we use, we need to include at least one value here.

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: terraform

provisioner:
  name: terraform
  variable_files:
    - testing.tfvars

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu
```

Next, let's add the transport section. This is what will allow
kitchen-terraform to ssh into your terraform'd instances and run your
inspec tests. You will need to include the path to the private key half
of your AWS keypair - wherever you keep it on your workstation.

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: terraform

provisioner:
  name: terraform
  variable_files:
    - testing.tfvars

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu

transport:
  name: ssh
  ssh_key: ~/path/to/your/private/aws/key.pem
```

And now let's add another section, the verifier section. The verifier
is what will verify whether your Test Kitchen instances match what is
laid out in your inspec files.

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: terraform

provisioner:
  name: terraform
  variable_files:
    - testing.tfvars

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu

transport:
  name: ssh
  ssh_key: ~/path/to/your/private/aws/key.pem

verifier:
  name: terraform
  format: doc
  groups:
    - name: default
      controls:
        - operating_system
      hostnames: public_dns
      username: ubuntu
```

And let's stop and talk about what we did here - as this is where you
will see some of the uniqueness of kitchen-terraform.

With these lines:

```yaml
verifier:
  name: terraform
  format: doc
```

We have specified that we are using the terraform verifier. We are also
using the format type of doc for our controls' output.

And we have also specified a group of controls.

```yaml
groups:
  - name: default
    controls:
      - operating_system
    hostnames: public_dns
    username: ubuntu
```

Our group's name is `default`, and we expect to find a control file
called `operating_system_spec.rb` within that group.

Additionally, kitchen-terraform also needs to know what hostnames it
needs to ssh into to run our specs. We have specified `public_dns` -
which is an output value we will need to add to `output.tf` in a bit.

Finally, there is the username - this is the name kitchen terraform will
use to ssh into the hostnames with. In this tutorial we are using
Ubuntu instances and the default username is `ubuntu`.

And, last, let's add a test suite to `.kitchen.yml`:

```yaml
---
driver:
  name: terraform

provisioner:
  name: terraform
  variable_files:
    - testing.tfvars

platforms:
  - name: ubuntu

transport:
  name: ssh
  ssh_key: ~/path/to/your/private/aws/key.pem

verifier:
  name: terraform
  format: doc
  groups:
    - name: default
      controls:
        - operating_system
      hostnames: public_dns
      username: ubuntu

suites:
  - name: default
```

Save and close the file.

## Writing a test

Now, we have some work to do on our workstation. First, let's set up
an `inspec` directory within our test directories

```bash
$ mkdir -p test/integration/default/controls
```

This will be our default group of tests. Now we need to provide a yml
file with the name of that group within the group directory. Go ahead
and create this:

```bash
$ vim test/integration/default/inspec.yml
```

And add this content:

```yaml
---
name: default
```

Save and close the file.

Now, just one more bit of housekeeping.  Our `.kitchen.yml` is expecting
an output of our test kitchen instances' hostnames within the output
variable, `public_dns`. In order to have a hostname within that `public_dns`
variable, we need to create an EC2 instance.

First, open up the main config file:

```bash
$ vim main.tf
```

And add this content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  access_key = "${var.access_key}"
  secret_key = "${var.secret_key}"
  region = "${var.region}"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "${var.ami}"
  instance_type = "${var.instance_type}"
  key_name = "${var.key_name}"
}
```

Save and close the file. Notice that we used some variable values there?
We need to add these into our `variables.tf` file.

Go ahead and create it.

```bash
$ vim variables.tf
```

And add in this content:

```hcl
variable "access_key" {}
variable "secret_key" {}
variable "key_name" {}
variable "region" {}
variable "ami" {}
variable "instance_type" {}
```

And, finally, we need to add in some values for these variables.

Open up your `testing.tfvars` file:

```bash
$ vim testing.tfvars
```

And add in this content (substitute in the appropriate values for your
AWS account, region, etc.)

```hcl
access_key = "my_aws_access_key"
secret_key = "my_aws_secret_key"
key_name = "my_aws_key_pair_name"
region = "us-east-1"
ami = "ami-fce3c696"
instance_type = "m3.medium"
```

Save and close the file.

Finally, let's define that output that will be expected by our
`.kitchen.yml`.

Go ahead and open up your `output.tf` file.

```bash
$ vim output.tf
```

And add this content:

```hcl
output "public_dns" {
  value = "${aws_instance.example.public_dns}"
}
```

Ok! Now we're ready to finally create some Test Kitchen instances!

Go ahead and run:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen converge
```

NOTE: If you receive the error "Error launching source instance:
VPCResourceNotSpecified: The specified instance type can only be
used in a VPC", check out the [EC2 t2 Instance Type Requirement]
document.

And it should converge successfully and you should see output that
includes:

```
Outputs:

public_dns = your_aws_instance_public_ip
```

Let's first try running the tests as is - even though we haven't written
any yet.

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```

And if it runs successfully, you should see output that includes:

```
0 examples, 0 failures
```

Let's add some tests!

Open up the file

```bash
$ vim test/integration/default/controls/operating_system_spec.rb
```

And let's add in a very basic test to make sure we are running on an
Ubuntu system.

```ruby
control 'operating_system' do
  describe command('lsb_release -a') do
    its('stdout') { should match (/Ubuntu/) }
  end
end
```

Now save and close the file and run the test.

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```

And hey, it passed! You should see output that includes:

```
Command lsb_release -a
  stdout
    should match /Ubuntu/
```

It's nice that it passed...but we still need to make sure that it fails
to be certain it tests what we think it tests.  Let's try changing our
Terraform config to spin up an Amazon Linux System, rather than an
Ubuntu system, and make sure that this test fails.

Go ahead and destroy your current test kitchen instances with:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen destroy
```

Open up your variables file

```bash
$ vim testing.tfvars
```

And change this content:

```hcl
region = "us-east-1"
instance_type = "m3.medium"
ami = "ami-fce3c696"
```

To this content (we are changing our AMI type to be an Amazon Linux AMI
within the us-east-1 AWS region.

```hcl
region = "us-east-1"
instance_type = "m3.medium"
ami = "ami-6869aa05"
```

Now create your test kitchen instance:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen converge
```

Now run the tests:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```

Whoops!  Looks like we got an error this run!

```
>>>>>> ------Exception-------
>>>>>> Class: Kitchen::ActionFailed
>>>>>> Message: 1 actions failed.
>>>>>>     Verify failed on instance <default-ubuntu>.  Please see
.kitchen/logs/default-ubuntu.log for more details
```

So let's take a look at the `.kitchen/log/default-ubuntu.log`.  Parsing
through the output, we see this:

```
ERROR -- default-ubuntu: Message: Transport error, can't connect to
'ssh' backend: SSH session could not be established
```

This is because of the verifier in our `.kitchen.yml`

```yaml
verifier:
  name: terraform
  format: doc
  groups:
    - name: default
      controls:
        - operating_system
      hostnames: public_dns
      username: ubuntu
```

Notice that the username we have specified for our test is `ubuntu` -
this is fine for an ubuntu instance, but for an Amazon Linux instance,
we need to use the `ec2-user` username

So let's go ahead and change that, the verifier section of your
`.kitchen.yml` should now look like this:

```yaml
verifier:
  name: terraform
  format: doc
  groups:
    - name: default
      controls:
        - operating_system
      hostnames: public_dns
      username: ec2-user
```

Now try running the tests again:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```

And now we see a test failure:

```
1) Command lsb_release -a stdout should match /Ubuntu/
   Failure/Error: DEFAULT_FAILURE_NOTIFIER =
   lambda { |failure, _opts| raise failure }\
   expected "" to match /Ubuntu/
    Diff:
    @@ -1,2 +1,2 @@
    -/Ubuntu/
    +""
```

Alright, that means our test is failing when it is supposed to be
failing, and passing when it is supposed to pass.

Open up your `.kitchen.yml` file and change the username back to ubuntu

```yaml
verifier:
  name: terraform
  format: doc
  groups:
    - name: default
      controls:
        - operating_system
      hostnames: public_dns
      username: ubuntu
```

And open up your `testing.tfvars` file and switch back to an Ubuntu AMI

```hcl
region = "us-east-1"
instance_type = "m3.medium"
ami = "ami-fce3c696"
```

Then destroy your current kitchen instances:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen destroy
```

Then converge again:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen converge
```

And then run verify one more time, now you should see everything pass:

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen verify
```

Huzzah!  This includes our "Getting Started" tutorial.

Now, make sure to destroy your test instances

```bash
$ bundle exec kitchen destroy
```

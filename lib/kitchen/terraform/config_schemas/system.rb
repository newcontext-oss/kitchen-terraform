      # A system is a mapping which is used to configure the execution of {https://www.inspec.io/docs/ InSpec tests}
      # against a system in the Terraform state. The keys of a system mapping correlate to the arguments and the
      # options of the {https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/cli/#exec +inspec exec+} command-line interface
      # subcomamand.
      #
      # ===== InSpec Profiles
      #
      # All systems within the same {https://kitchen.ci/docs/getting-started/adding-suite Kitchen suite} are by default
      # tested using the same {https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/ InSpec profile}. The profile must be
      # implemented in the directory located at `<Kitchen root>/test/integration/<suite name>`. This behaviour can be
      # overridden with the <code>profile_locations</code> key.
      #
      # The values of any {https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html Terraform variables} configured
      # with the driver's <code>variables</code> attribute and the values of any
      # {https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/outputs.html Terraform outputs} which exist in the Terraform state
      # are associated with equivalently named
      # {https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/profiles/#profile-attributes InSpec profile attributes}, prefixed with
      # <code>input_</code> or <code>output_</code>, respectively. The values of the outputs are also associated with
      # equivalently named profile attributes without any prefixes for backward compatibility. Output associations can
      # be overridden with the <code>attrs_outputs</code> key. For example, the value of a variable named `test` will
      # be associated with an attribute named `input_test`, and the value of an output named `test` will be associated
      # with an attribute named `output_test` as well as an attribute named `test`.
      #
      # ===== Required Keys

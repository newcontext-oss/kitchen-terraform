# Enumerates each group and the hostnames of each group.
#
# If a group associates +:hostnames+ with a value then that value is assumed to be the name of a Terraform output
# variable which has a value of a string or array containing one or more hostnames; those hostnames will be enumerated
# with the group.
#
# If a group omits +:hostnames+ then the hostname +"localhost"+ will be enumerated with that group; this hostname will
# cause the InSpec profile to be executed locally and enable verification of resources in the Terraform state without
# the use of Secure Shell (SSH).
